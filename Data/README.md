# Datasets

We are also open sourcing two datasets along with this code for easy replication of our results and help future researchers working on the same/related problem.

Please download the dataset from the following kaggle links:
 - CARLA-64 Dataset
   - Raw : These contain all the data directly collected from Carla simulator
   - (Update) - We released a new version of the dataset available. The raw files and the preprocessed data in range image is available below
     - [[Training]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ssahoodotinfinity/carla-64-training) 
     - [[Testing]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ssahoodotinfinity/carla64-preprocessed-range-image-dataset)
     - 
   - CARLA SLAM Odometery Sequences
     - [[Odometry Sequences]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ssahoodotinfinity/carla64-dynamic-lidar-dataset)

        
 - ARD-16 Dataset : These contain all the data collected (and processed) on a moving robot.
 -  This below used for training and testing the model
   - [[Dynamic and Static-Raw]](https://www.kaggle.com/ssahoodotinfinity/ard16-dynamic-static-lidar-dataset) (21 GB)
 - For SLAM, we use the single sequence available at the below link
   - [Odometry Sequence]()
