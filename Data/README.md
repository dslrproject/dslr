# Datasets

We are also open sourcing two datasets along with this code for easy replication of our results and help future researchers working on the same/related problem.

Please download the dataset from the following kaggle links:
 - CARLA-64 Dataset
   - Raw : These contain all the data directly collected from Carla simulator
   - (Update) - We released a new version of the dataset available. The raw files and the preprocessed data in range image is available below
     - [[Dynamic-raw]](https://www.kaggle.com/ssahoodotinfinity/carla64-dynamic-lidar-dataset) (86 GB)
     - [[Static-raw]](https://www.kaggle.com/ssahoodotinfinity/carla64-static-lidar-dataset) (47 GB)
   - Processed : These contain only the preprocessed data, ready to be fed to DSLR model for training/testing
     - [[Paired Preprocessed Range Images]](https://www.kaggle.com/ssahoodotinfinity/carla64-preprocessed-range-image-dataset) (16 GB)
 - ARD-16 Dataset : These contain all the data collected (and processed to have similar folder layout) on a moving robot
   - [[Dynamic and Static]](https://www.kaggle.com/ssahoodotinfinity/ard16-dynamic-static-lidar-dataset) (21 GB)
